How intensive the spread of the virus has been in the countries? Does covid19 national lockdowns and self-isolations in Pakistan have actually impact on COVID19 transmission? we are going to use Plotly module, which is a great visualization tool in python, in order to plot some insightful and intuitive graphs to answer the questions.
